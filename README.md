# Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise

## Objective
To write a web service that accepts HTTP requests and returns responses based on conditions, set in the background information below, for a payer/points system.

### Background
- Users have points in their accounts
- Users only see a single balance in their accounts. However, for reporting purposes User points are tracked through points per payer/partner
- Each transaction record contains: payer (string), points (integer), timestamp (date)
- When a User spends points, they don't know or care which payer the points come from. But, the accounting team does care how the points are spent
- There are two rules for determining what points to "spend" first:
  - the oldest points to be spent first (oldest based on transaction timestamp, not the order theyâ€™re received)
  - no payer's points to go negative

### Expectations of Web Server
Provide routes that:
1.  Add transactions for a specific payer and date
2. Spend points using the rules above and return a list of { "payer": string, "points": integer } for each call
3. Return all payer point balances

_Please note:_ For illustrative purposes, timestamp is in the "yyyy-mm-dd" format.

### Technologies Used
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Postman (for testing routes)

## How to Get Started
1. Fork and then clone this repo
2. In your terminal (make sure you are in the root of the repo), run:

```
 npm install
```

- This will install all necessary dependencies from the package.json file.

3. Once all dependencies are installed, in your terminal run the following custom script to start the development server:
```
 npm run dev
```
4. Once your server is running, open up Postman to test routes

### Testing Code
We will implement three routes based on the expectations listed above:

1. POST request to "/points" to add transactions for a specific payer and date
2. POST request to "/points/spend" to deduct points, based on rules listed in background section, and return a list of { "payer": string, "points": integer } for each call
3. GET request to "/points" for all payer point balances

_Please note:_ All endpoints are pre-pended with "/api". For example, in local development we would make a GET request to "localhost:3000/api/points".

Once the server is running (see "How to Get Started" section above), open up Postman to test each route.

#### Testing First Route
We start by adding several transactions. In order to add a transaction via Postman: 
1) make a POST request to the path "localhost:3000/api/points" 
2) add a body to the post request - choose the "body" tab, then select the options "raw" and "json" (screenshot below). 

Example transactions below (you may copy/paste each into postman):

```
  { "payer": "DANNON", "points": 2000, "timestamp": "2020-11-05" }
```

```
{ "payer": "UNILEVER", "points": 1000, "timestamp": "2019-10-31" }
```

```
{ "payer": "APPLE", "points": 1500, "timestamp": "2018-10-31" }
```

```
{ "payer": "MILLER COORS", "points": 10000, "timestamp": "2020-11-01" }
```

```
{ "payer": "ORANGE", "points": 3000, "timestamp": "2020-10-31" }
```

_Please note:_ Directions on how to handle duplicates were not 100% clear. One option was to list each transaction as seperate - even for the same payer. For demonstation purposes however, the option selected for duplicates was to combine the points of an already existing payer and keep original timestamp.

#### Testing Second Route
In order to spend points via Postman: 
1) make a POST request to the path "localhost:3000/api/points/spend" 
2) add a body to the post request - choose the options "raw" and "json". 

Example of body in post request below (you may copy/paste each into postman):

```
 { "points": 3000 }
```

The expected response will be a list of { "payer": string, "points": integer }

#### Testing Third Route
1) make a GET request to the path "localhost:3000/api/points"

This will give you a print out of payers and their remaining balances.
